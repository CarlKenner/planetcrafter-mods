# Fix Units

Fixes how units, such as kW, are displayed. Power is now measured in kW instead of kW/h or kW/s (which made no sense).
Oxygen no longer stops at ppm, and is now displayed as a percentage once it reaches 1,000 ppm. Earth is 21% oxygen, if you want a target to aim for.
All values are now displayed with thousand separators (commas), except in the build menu.
