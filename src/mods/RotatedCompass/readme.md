# Rotated Compass (obsolete)

Rotates the in-game compass labels 90 degrees clockwise, giving the appearance that East is now North.

Note: Do not use this mod. Miju Games have fixed the compass orientation as of `0.4.009` (early May 2022) so
that north is actually north (see the `After` screenshot). The purpose of this mod was to do exactly that,
and now that is buit into the game by default.

Installing this mod into game version `0.4.009` or later will cause the compass to be rotated too far, putting West
where North should be.


## Before (out-dated)

Compass orientation before `0.4.009`, looking toward the largest moon.
Note the label for East is where North is expected to be.

As of `0.4.009`, this is no longer the default behavior.

## After

As of `0.4.009`, this `After` screenshot is the default compass orientation.
